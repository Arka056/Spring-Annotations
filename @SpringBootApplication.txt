@SpringBootApplication: 
  It is the core SpringBoot Annotation.
  It indicates a configuration class that declares 1 or more @Bean methods and triggers AutoConfiguration.
It is composed of 3 annotations, they are:
1) @Configuration: It marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
2) @EnableAutoConfiguration: It automatically configures beans based on the classpath.
3) @ComponentScan: Scans the package for components, services, and repositories.

Without the @SpringBootApplication annotation, we have to write and manage those 3 classes manually.
